                        With this site, you can see the effects
                        of how quick or slow the virus spreads 
                        depending on differing enviromental conditions 
                        and the social distancing measures taken.

                        Governemental agencies and technical advisors. 
                        It is paramount that our leaders understand the 
                        impact of social distancing as broadly as possible.
                        With this simulation, we hope to further this understanding.

                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The page has an enviroment with lots of bubbles that represent individuals. Red 
                    bubbles are infected, blue are healthy, grey are immune. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Some bubbles will be immobile and some move around. If a red (sick)
                    bubble bumps into a blue (healthy) bubble, it will turn 
                    red. After a short time, the red bubbles will turn grey (immune/recovered).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You have the ability to control the size of the environment, the size of the bubbles,
                    the number of bubbles (up to 500) and which ones stay still, the initial ratio of sick
                    to healthy, and the speed of the bubbles.
