1.
a. Why is it important ?
We believe showcasing a simulation would be valuable to teach the importance of socail distancing.
b. What can I do with it ?
With this site, you can see the effects of how quick or slow the virus spreads depending on differing enviromental conditions and the social distancing measures taken.
c. Who is it for ?
Governemental agencies and technical advisors. It is paramount that our leaders understand the impact of social distancing as broadly as possible. With this simulation, we hope to further this understanding.

2. Quick-Start Guide:

a. Click the "login" button to go to the login page.
b. Login.
c. You are now on the simulation page.
d. The page has an enviroment with lots of bubbles that represent individuals. Red bubbles are infected, blue are healthy. (Grey are immune)
e. bubbles will be immobile and move around. if a (sick)red bubble bumps into a (healthy)blue bubble, the blue bubble will turn red. (optional: after a time, the red bubbles will turn (immune)grey.
f. Control the following variables:
	-page size: controls how big the enviroment is.
	-radius: controls size of individual bubbles.
	-# of bubbles: controls number of bubbles (up to 500 bubbles).
	-# of static: controls number of immobile bubbles.
	-ratio: initial ratio of sick and healthy bubbles.
	-speed: how fast the bubbles can go.
